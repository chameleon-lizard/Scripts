# YAMDS
YAMDS - Yet Another Music Download Script

This simple script lets you download an entire playlist/album from Youtube Music (or audio from a video or a playlist on regular Youtube), get rid of ugly characters after dash in the name of the files and move them into a directory with the specified name.

# Dependencies
[youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/) - needed to fetch music from Youtube Music.

# RWS
RWS - Random Wallpapers Script

This simple script fetches a random picture from a directory, sets it as a wallpaper, generates a new colorscheme for terminal using pywal and creates a colorscheme for Telegram. Put it into autorun and change configs for your bar, WM and vim (if you want to use colorscheme in the best editor ever).

# Dependencies
[telegram-palette-gen](https://github.com/matgua/telegram-palette-gen) - used to create themes for Telegram.

[pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) - used to create colorschemes from your wallpapers.

[wal-set](pywal) - used to generate colors for polybar. Or not, I just found it on [this](https://www.maketecheasier.com/create-color-schemes-match-wallpaper-linux/) site and used it. It works, so I don't really care.
